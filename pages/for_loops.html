      <h2>For Loops</h2>
      <p>For loops are one of the most fundamental programming concepts in Python, designed to execute a block of code repeatedly for each item in a sequence or collection. Think of them as an automated way to perform the same task multiple times without having to write the same code over and over again. The basic structure follows the pattern "for each item in this collection, do something with it", making them incredibly useful for processing lists, strings, numbers, or any other iterable data structure.</p>
      <p>The syntax is straightforward: you write for followed by a variable name, then in, then the collection you want to iterate through, ending with a colon. For example, for name in ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']: would loop through each name in the list, and you can then perform actions with each name inside the indented code block that follows. You might print each name, add it to another list, or use it in calculations. The variable (in this case name) temporarily holds each item as the loop progresses through the collection.</p>
      <p>In data analysis roles, for loops are essential for processing large datasets. A financial analyst might use them to calculate monthly returns for hundreds of stocks, iterating through each company's data to perform the same calculation. Marketing professionals working with customer data could loop through email lists to personalise messages or segment customers based on their purchase history. The loop handles the repetitive work whilst ensuring each record receives the same treatment, reducing errors and saving enormous amounts of time.</p>
      <p>Software developers and web developers rely heavily on for loops for various tasks. They might loop through user inputs to validate form data, iterate through database records to generate reports, or process files in a directory for backup operations. Game developers use loops to update the positions of multiple characters or objects on screen, whilst mobile app developers might loop through notification lists to display them to users. The versatility means they're applicable across virtually every programming project.</p>
      <p>Even in non-technical roles that involve Python scripting, for loops prove invaluable. Administrative staff might use them to rename hundreds of files systematically, teachers could loop through student grades to calculate class averages, and researchers might iterate through survey responses to extract specific information. The key advantage is automation: instead of manually performing the same task repeatedly, you write the loop once and let Python handle the repetition, making your work more efficient and less prone to human error.</p>
