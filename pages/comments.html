      <h2>Comments and Docstrings</h2>
      <p>Comments and docstrings are essential tools in Python programming that help make your code more readable and maintainable. Comments are short notes you write directly in your code using the hash symbol (#) to explain what specific lines or sections do. They're ignored by the Python interpreter when your program runs, so they exist purely for human readers. For example, you might write # Calculate the total price including VAT above a line that performs a calculation. Comments are particularly useful for explaining complex logic, noting why you made certain decisions, or providing context that isn't immediately obvious from the code itself.</p>
      <p>Docstrings, on the other hand, are more formal documentation strings that describe what entire functions, classes, or modules do. They're written using triple quotes (""" or ''') and are placed immediately after the definition of a function, class, or at the top of a module. Unlike comments, docstrings are actually stored as part of the code object and can be accessed programmatically. A typical docstring might look like: """Calculate the total price including VAT. Returns the final price as a float.""" This tells anyone using your function exactly what it does and what to expect as a result.</p>
      <p>The key difference between comments and docstrings lies in their scope and purpose. Comments are for explaining specific lines or small sections of code and are meant for developers who are reading through the implementation. Docstrings are for documenting the overall purpose and behaviour of larger code components and are intended for anyone who needs to use your code, including your future self. Comments answer "how" or "why" questions about the implementation, whilst docstrings answer "what" questions about functionality. Additionally, many development tools can automatically generate documentation from docstrings, making them invaluable for creating professional code documentation.</p>
      <p>In real workplace scenarios, comments are extensively used during code reviews and maintenance. For instance, a data analyst might comment their code with # Remove outliers beyond 3 standard deviations to explain a data cleaning step, or a web developer might note # TODO: Add input validation for email addresses to flag future improvements. Comments are also crucial when working with complex algorithms or business logic that might not be immediately clear to other team members. They serve as a communication tool between developers and help prevent misunderstandings about code intent.</p>
      <p>Docstrings prove their worth in professional environments when creating reusable code libraries, APIs, or any functions that will be used by multiple team members. A software engineer might write a docstring like """Connects to the customer database and retrieves order history. Parameters: customer_id (int): The unique identifier for the customer. Returns: List of dictionaries containing order details.""" This allows colleagues to understand and use the function without needing to read through its implementation. Many companies use tools like Sphinx to automatically generate professional documentation websites from these docstrings, creating comprehensive guides for their codebases. This practice is particularly important in collaborative environments where clear documentation can save hours of time and reduce errors.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <p>Some examples of the syntax and usage of comments and docstrings:</p>
