      <h2>While Loops</h2>
      <p>A while loop is another fundamental programming construct that allows your code to repeat a set of instructions as long as a specific condition remains true. Think of it like giving someone directions that include "keep walking straight until you reach the traffic lights" - the person will continue walking (the repeated action) until they meet the condition of reaching the traffic lights. In programming terms, the while loop evaluates a condition before each iteration, and if that condition is true, it executes the code inside the loop block. This process continues until the condition becomes false, at which point the program moves on to the next instruction after the loop.</p>
      <p>The basic structure of a while loop is quite straightforward. You start with the keyword "while" followed by a condition in parentheses, then place the code you want to repeat inside curly braces. For example, you might write while (counter < 10) followed by code that increments the counter and performs some task. The key thing to remember is that something inside the loop must eventually change the condition to false, otherwise you'll create an infinite loop that never stops running. This is why most while loops include a statement that modifies the variable being tested in the condition, such as adding 1 to a counter or updating a status flag.</p>
      <p>In real-world software development jobs, while loops are incredibly useful for handling situations where you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat an operation. Web developers often use them when processing user input - for instance, continuously asking a user to enter a valid email address until they provide one that meets the required format. Database administrators and backend developers frequently employ while loops when reading through records in a database, processing each row of results until there are no more records to handle. Game developers use them extensively for the main game loop that keeps running until the player quits or the game ends.</p>
      <p>While loops are particularly valuable in data processing roles, where you might need to read through files of unknown size or process streaming data. A data analyst might use a while loop to clean a dataset by repeatedly removing invalid entries until no more problematic data remains. System administrators often write scripts with while loops to monitor server performance, continuously checking system metrics until certain thresholds are met or exceeded. In automated testing jobs, while loops can simulate user behaviour by repeatedly clicking buttons or entering data until a specific response is received from the application being tested.</p>
      <p>Understanding while loops is essential because they represent a core programming concept that appears in virtually every programming language and job role that involves coding. Whether you're working as a software engineer building mobile apps, a DevOps engineer writing deployment scripts, or a financial analyst creating automated reports, you'll find while loops invaluable for tasks that require repetition with an unknown endpoint. They're particularly powerful when combined with user input, file processing, or any scenario where your program needs to respond dynamically to changing conditions rather than simply repeating a fixed number of times.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <p>Some examples of real usage of while loops:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
# 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE - Processing support tickets until queue is empty
import time

def process_support_queue():
    tickets_remaining = get_ticket_count()  # Imagine this returns current queue size
    while tickets_remaining > 0:
        ticket = get_next_ticket()
        process_ticket(ticket)
        tickets_remaining = get_ticket_count()
        print(f"Processed ticket. {tickets_remaining} tickets remaining.")

# 2. WEB SCRAPING - Continue scraping pages until no "Next" button exists
def scrape_product_catalogue():
    current_page = 1

        products = scrape_page(current_page)
        save_products_to_database(products)
        has_next_page = check_for_next_button()
        current_page += 1
        time.sleep(2)  # Respectful scraping delay

# 3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS - Monitor stock price until target reached
def monitor_stock_price(symbol, target_price):
    current_price = get_stock_price(symbol)
    
    while current_price < target_price:
        print(f"{symbol}: £{current_price} (Target: £{target_price})")
