      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <p>Classes in Python are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allow you to create your own custom data types. Think of a class as a blueprint or template for creating objects. Just as an architect might create a blueprint for a house that can be used to build many similar houses, a class defines the structure and behaviour that objects created from it will have. Each individual object created from a class is called an "instance" of that class.</p>
      <p>To understand classes better, consider a real-world example. Imagine you want to represent cars in your program. You could create a Car class that defines what properties every car should have (like colour, make, model, and year) and what actions every car can perform (like starting the engine, accelerating, or braking). Once you've defined this Car class, you can create multiple car objects from it, each with their own specific values for colour, make, and model.</p>
      <p>The properties of a class are called "attributes" or "instance variables", whilst the actions are called "methods". Attributes store data about each object, such as a person's name or age if you're creating a Person class. Methods are functions that belong to the class and can perform operations on the object's data or carry out specific tasks. For example, a Person class might have a method called "introduce" that prints out the person's name and age.</p>
      <p>Creating a class in Python uses the class keyword followed by the class name. By convention, class names use PascalCase (starting with a capital letter). Inside the class, you define a special method called __init__, which is the constructor method that runs automatically when you create a new instance of the class. This method typically sets up the initial values for the object's attributes using the parameters passed to it.</p>
      <p>Here's how you might create instances (objects) from your class: once you've defined a class, you create objects by calling the class name like a function and passing any required arguments. For example, if you have a Person class, you might write person1 = Person("Alice", 25) to create a new person object. You can then access the object's attributes using dot notation, like person1.name, and call its methods, such as person1.introduce().</p>
      <p>One of the main advantages of using classes is that they help organise your code and make it more reusable. Instead of having separate variables and functions scattered throughout your program, you can group related data and functionality together within a class. This makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Additionally, you can create multiple objects from the same class, each with their own data, without having to duplicate code.</p>
      <p>Classes also support more advanced concepts like inheritance, where you can create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and methods whilst adding new functionality. This allows you to build hierarchies of related classes and avoid repeating code. For beginners, start with simple classes that group related data and functions together, and as you become more comfortable with the concept, you can explore these more advanced features to write even more efficient and organised code.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
