      <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
      <p>Conditional statements are fundamental building blocks in Python programming that allow your code to make decisions based on different circumstances. Think of them as the "if-then" logic that humans use every day - if it's raining, then take an umbrella. In Python, these statements use keywords like if, elif (else if), and else to control which parts of your code execute depending on whether certain conditions are true or false. The basic syntax involves writing if followed by a condition, then a colon, with the code to execute indented on the following lines.</p>
      <p>The most common conditional statements start with a simple if statement. For example, if temperature > 25: might trigger code that turns on air conditioning. You can extend this logic with elif to check multiple conditions in sequence, such as elif temperature < 10: to turn on heating instead. Finally, else acts as a catch-all for any situation not covered by the previous conditions. The conditions themselves often use comparison operators like == (equals), != (not equals), > (greater than), < (less than), and logical operators like and, or, and not to create more complex decision-making logic.</p>
      <p>In web development roles, conditional statements are everywhere. A web developer might use them to check if a user is logged in before displaying certain content, or to validate form data before processing it. For instance, if user.is_authenticated: could show a personalised dashboard, whilst else: might redirect to a login page. E-commerce sites rely heavily on conditionals to apply discounts, check stock levels, or determine shipping costs based on location and item weight. These statements ensure that users see relevant content and that the website behaves appropriately under different circumstances.</p>
      <p>Data analysts and scientists use conditional statements extensively for data cleaning and analysis. They might write if pd.isna(value): to handle missing data points, or use conditions to categorise data into groups. For example, a marketing analyst could use conditionals to segment customers based on spending habits: if total_spent > 1000: assigns them to a "premium" category. Financial analysts use these statements to flag unusual transactions, calculate different tax rates based on income brackets, or trigger alerts when certain market conditions are met.</p>
      <p>In automation and systems administration, conditional statements are crucial for creating robust, self-managing systems. A system administrator might write scripts that check disk space and send alerts when storage is running low, or automatically restart services if they stop responding. DevOps engineers use conditionals in deployment scripts to handle different environments - perhaps if environment == 'production': uses different database settings than development. Even simple task automation, like organising files based on their extensions or processing emails based on their sender, relies heavily on conditional logic to make intelligent decisions about how to handle different scenarios.</p>
