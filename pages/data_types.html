      <h2>Basic and Compound Data Types</h2>
      <p>Data types in Python are fundamental categories that define what kind of information a variable can store and what operations can be performed on that information. Think of data types as containers with specific rules - just like how you wouldn't put liquid in a paper bag or store books in a fishbowl, different types of data need appropriate containers. When you create a variable in Python, the language automatically determines what type of data you're working with, but understanding these types is crucial for writing effective programs.</p>
      <p>The importance of data types extends far beyond basic programming concepts. They determine how much memory your program uses, what operations are available, and even how fast your code runs. When Python knows that a variable contains a number, it can perform mathematical operations on it. When it knows a variable contains text, it provides string manipulation methods. This type awareness prevents errors and makes your code more predictable and reliable.</p>
      <h3>Basic Data Types</h3>
      <p>Python's basic data types, also called primitive types, represent single values and cannot be broken down into smaller components within the programming context. The most common basic types include integers for whole numbers, floats for decimal numbers, strings for text, and booleans for true/false values. These types form the building blocks of more complex data structures and are designed to be simple, efficient, and straightforward to use.</p>
      <p>Integers in Python represent whole numbers without decimal points, such as -5, 0, 42, or 1000. They're perfect for counting, indexing, and any situation where fractional values don't make sense. In a real-world banking application, integers might be used to store account numbers, the number of transactions, or user IDs. The banking system needs these values to remain whole numbers because you can't have half a transaction or 3.7 customers.</p>
      <p>Floating-point numbers, or floats, handle decimal values like 3.14159, -0.5, or 2.0. These are essential for precise calculations involving measurements, percentages, or any continuous values. In a financial trading platform, floats would store stock prices, percentage changes, or currency exchange rates. A stock price of £127.43 needs that decimal precision because the difference between £127.43 and £127.44 represents real money.</p>
      <p>Strings contain text data, enclosed in quotes, such as "Hello World", "user@email.com", or "Product Description". They're used whenever you need to store or manipulate text. In an e-commerce website, strings would store product names, customer addresses, email addresses, and reviews. The customer service system needs to search through complaint descriptions, format personalised emails, and validate that email addresses contain proper characters.</p>
      <p>Boolean values represent simple true/false states and are fundamental to decision-making in programs. They're often the result of comparisons or logical operations. In a hospital patient management system, booleans might track whether a patient is currently admitted or whether they've completed required paperwork. These yes/no decisions drive different workflows and determine what actions the system should take.</p>
      <h3>Compound Data Types</h3>
      <p>Compound data types, in contrast to basic types, can store multiple values or more complex structures. These include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. While basic types hold single pieces of information, compound types organise and structure multiple pieces of related data. They're like containers that can hold multiple basic types or even other compound types, creating sophisticated data structures that mirror real-world complexity.</p>
      <p>Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items and allow for modification after creation. In a project management application, a list might contain all the tasks assigned to a team member, where new tasks can be added, completed tasks can be removed, and the order might represent priority. The marketing team's task list could start with "Create campaign proposal" and "Design graphics," then have "Schedule social media posts" added later as priorities shift.</p>
      <p>Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making them perfect for representing relationships and structured information. In a customer relationship management system, a dictionary might represent a single customer with keys like "name", "email", "purchase_history", and "preferred_contact_method". This allows the sales team to quickly access specific information about any customer - they can look up someone's email address or check their purchase history without having to remember the exact position of that information in a list. The human resources department might use dictionaries to store employee records, where each employee's information includes their department, salary, start date, and performance ratings, making it easy to retrieve specific details during reviews or when processing payroll.</p>
      <p>Understanding Python data types is like learning the vocabulary of a new language - once you grasp these fundamental concepts, you can begin constructing more sophisticated programs. Basic data types handle individual pieces of information with precision and efficiency, while compound data types allow you to organise and structure complex relationships between multiple pieces of data. Whether you're building a simple calculator that uses integers and floats, a customer database that relies on dictionaries and strings, or an inventory system that combines lists and booleans, choosing the appropriate data type for each situation will make your code more reliable, readable, and maintainable. As you continue your Python journey, these data types will become second nature, forming the foundation upon which all your future programming skills will build.</p>
