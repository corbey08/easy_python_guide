      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Think of them as mini-programmes within your main programme that you can call upon whenever you need them. Just like how you might have a recipe for making tea that you follow the same way each time, a function contains a set of instructions that executes the same way whenever you "call" or use it. Functions help programmers avoid writing the same code repeatedly and make programmes easier to understand, test, and maintain.</p>
      <p>The basic structure of a Python function starts with the keyword "def", followed by the function name and parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you can specify parameters (inputs the function needs), and the function can return a result. For example, a simple function might look like: def calculate_vat(price): return price * 0.2. This function takes a price as input and returns the VAT amount. You'd call it by writing vat_amount = calculate_vat(100), which would give you 20.</p>
      <p>In data analysis roles, functions are absolutely essential. Data analysts frequently write functions to clean datasets, calculate statistics, or generate reports. For instance, a function might standardise phone numbers by removing spaces and formatting them consistently, or calculate monthly sales totals from daily transaction data. Rather than copying and pasting the same data cleaning code for each new dataset, analysts create functions they can reuse across different projects, saving enormous amounts of time and reducing errors.</p>
      <p>Web developers use functions extensively to handle user interactions and process data. A function might validate whether an email address is properly formatted before allowing a user to register for an account, or calculate shipping costs based on a customer's location and order weight. E-commerce websites rely on functions to process payments, update inventory levels, and send confirmation emails. These functions ensure that complex business logic is handled consistently every time a customer makes a purchase.</p>
      <p>In financial services, functions are crucial for risk calculations, portfolio analysis, and regulatory reporting. A quantitative analyst might write functions to calculate Value at Risk for investment portfolios, or to determine loan approval based on credit scores and income ratios. These functions often incorporate complex mathematical models but present simple interfaces that other team members can use without understanding the underlying complexity.</p>
      <p>Automation specialists use functions to streamline repetitive tasks across various industries. For example, a function might automatically generate monthly reports by pulling data from multiple systems, formatting it consistently, and emailing it to stakeholders. In marketing roles, functions could analyse customer behaviour data to segment audiences or calculate campaign effectiveness metrics. The beauty of functions is that once written and tested, they can run reliably without manual intervention.</p>
      <p>Functions also promote collaboration in professional environments. When working on large projects with multiple developers, functions allow team members to work on different parts of the system independently. One developer might create functions for user authentication whilst another writes functions for data processing. Because functions have clear inputs and outputs, team members can integrate their work seamlessly, making professional software development both efficient and manageable.</p>
