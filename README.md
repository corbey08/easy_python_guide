## Description

Easy Python Guide is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly website designed to introduce fundamental Python programming concepts. As a self-paced learning resource, it breaks down complex topics into digestible lessons, making Python accessible to absolute beginners. The site provides a clean, user-friendly interface with features like a theme switcher for personalised viewing and structured content across numerous pages, guiding users from basic syntax to more advanced concepts.

This project demonstrates my ability to not only develop a functional website but also to organise and present educational content effectively.

## Key Features

- **Beginner-Friendly Content**: 25 dedicated pages covering various Python subjects, from data types to functions and classes
- **Theme Switcher**: Allows users to toggle between light and dark modes for improved readability and user preference
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless learning experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
- **Intuitive Navigation**: A well-organised structure with a sidebar for easy access to all lessons
- **SEO Optimization**: Includes sitemap.xml and robots.txt for better search engine discoverability
- **Legal Pages**: Dedicated privacy-policy.html and terms-of-service.html for user transparency

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring all the educational content and website layout
- **CSS3** (styles-light.css, styles-dark.css): For styling, responsive design, and implementing the light and dark themes
- **JavaScript** (sidebar.js, theme-switcher.js): Powers the interactive sidebar navigation and the user-controlled theme switching functionality
- **Basic SEO Principles**: Implementation of sitemap.xml and robots.txt
