📝 Description
Easy Python Guide is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly website designed to introduce fundamental Python programming concepts. As a self-paced learning resource, it breaks down complex topics into digestible lessons, making Python accessible to absolute beginners. The site provides a clean, user-friendly interface with features like a theme switcher for personalised viewing and structured content across numerous pages, guiding users from basic syntax to more advanced concepts.

This project demonstrates my ability to not only develop a functional website but also to organise and present educational content effectively.

Theme Switcher: Allows users to toggle between light and dark modes for improved readability and user preference.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless learning experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Intuitive Navigation: A well-organized structure with a sidebar for easy access to all lessons.

SEO Optimization: Includes sitemap.xml and robots.txt for better search engine discoverability.

Legal Pages: Dedicated privacy-policy.html and terms-of-service.html for user transparency.
